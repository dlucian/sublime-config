# Sublime Text Configuration

This repository contains configuration of Sublime Text. I've
committed it to git, so that I can use it across my devices and
to have it in case I loose it, as I have lost it before and it
took a while before I was able to set everything the way it was.

This repository is supposed to be in:

```
/Users/lucian/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User
```
